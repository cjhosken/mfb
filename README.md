# MoonRay for Blender

MoonRay for Blender is a render engine addon which allows users to utilise Dreamworks' MoonRay Production Renderer inside of Blender.

## Installing

To use, download the latest release of the MoonRayForBlender addon and save the zip file. 

Start Blender and from `File -> User Preferences -> Add-ons` install the zip file.

You should then be able to select MoonRay in the render engines.

## Getting Help

If you need help, report an issue and I will try to deal with it as soon as possible.

## Support

* Blender 3.4.1

Currently, this addon is not linked to MoonRay, due to issues with building the render engine.
